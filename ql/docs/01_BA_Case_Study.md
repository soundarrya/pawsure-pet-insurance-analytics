1) Business Background:
   
   * At PawSure Insurance, our mission is simple yet deeply emotional — to make sure that when a pet is sick or injured, their families don’t have to worry about the financial side of care.
   * We provide health insurance for dogs and cats across India’s top five metro cities. It’s a business powered by both compassion and data — we’re driven to protect pets, but we also need to stay financially healthy so that protection remains sustainable.
   * Lately, our claim data has been telling us a story. Out of a recent dataset of 100 claims, we’ve seen a sharp rise in both the number and the cost of orthopedic surgeries. Many of these expensive claims are linked to specific clinics and cities.
   * This upward trend is affecting our financial balance — squeezing our underwriting margins and pushing up loss ratios. If the trend continues unchecked, it could lead to higher premiums and erode customer trust.
   * We’re now at a crucial turning point where empathy meets economics. To continue protecting pet parents and their companions, we need to better understand what’s truly driving this surge in claim costs — and respond with data-backed, actionable steps.

3) Core Problem Statement
    * The leadership team at PawSure has one pressing concern:
    * Our claim payout costs are steadily increasing month over month.
    * This isn’t just a financial issue — it’s a sustainability challenge.

We need to identify what’s truly fueling these costs. That means asking focused, high-impact questions:

| Key Question                                               | Why It Matters                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Which diseases are driving higher claim costs?             | Helps us set fair treatment caps or adjust coverage terms          |
| Are certain clinics or cities consistently more expensive? | Enables negotiation of fairer tariffs or detection of overcharging |
| Do older pets generate higher-cost claims?                 | Supports fair, risk-adjusted pricing                               |
| Are some claims abnormally high or suspicious?             | Helps detect potential fraud                                       |

At its heart, this analysis is not just about trends — it’s about turning those trends into actionable insights that safeguard both our customers and our business.

Our goals are clear:
  * Protect PawSure’s financial health.
  * Preserve the trust of pet parents.

3) Stakeholder Analysis
Every insight in this project touches multiple teams, each with different goals but one shared mission — delivering security to pet families without compromising business sustainability.

| Stakeholder               | What They Care About                                 | Why This Matters                                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CFO                       | Underwriting margins, loss ratios, pricing stability | Needs clarity on what’s eroding profits                      |
| Head of Claims Operations | Smooth, accurate claim processing                    | Needs transparency into cost drivers and claim approval gaps |
| Head of Underwriting      | Data-driven risk pricing                             | Supports premium decisions tied to real risk                 |
| Partner Vet Clinics       | Fair and transparent billing                         | Enables collaborative cost control                           |
| Data & Analytics Team     | Data quality and reliability                         | Ensures strong dashboards and early fraud detection          |

Shared understanding:
We must manage costs intelligently — not by denying claims, but by preventing predictable financial leakage. 

4) KPIs to Measure the Business Problem
Cost KPIs – Financial Health

| KPI                         | Why It Matters                           |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Average Claim Amount        | Tracks cost escalation per claim         |
| Total Monthly Claim Payouts | Measures profitability trends            |
| Average Cost per Disease    | Identifies high-cost categories          |
| High-Cost Claim %           | Highlights disproportionate claim growth |

Operational KPIs – Efficiency

| KPI                     | Why It Matters                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Average Days to Approve | Reflects customer experience           |
| Approval Rate %         | Ensures process accuracy               |
| Rejection Rate %        | Flags data or fraud sensitivity issues |

Risk KPIs – Exposure

| KPI                           | Why It Matters                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Suspected Fraud Count         | Detects abnormal claims early     |
| Disease Cost Volatility       | Identifies unpredictable patterns |
| Clinic-Level High Claim Ratio | Targets potential overcharging    |

Together, these metrics turn assumptions into facts and provide the foundation for smarter conversations and decisions.

5) Current State — Where the Pains Are
What We’re Seeing
    * Orthopedic surgeries are repeatedly topping the expense charts.
    * A few clinics account for a large share of high payouts.
    * Older pets tend to have more expensive claims.
    * Approval speed varies widely between cities, affecting SLAs.

| What’s Going Wrong                        | How It Impacts PawSure         |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Premiums don’t reflect high-cost diseases | Erodes margins                 |
| Some clinics may be overcharging          | Inflates payouts unnecessarily |
| No fraud automation in place              | Suspicious claims slip through |
| SLA variance by region                    | Hurts customer trust           |

6) Recommendations & Action Plan

* Phase 2 – Mid-Term Fixes (4–8 Weeks)

| Step                            | Why                            |

| Reprice policies for older pets | Aligns coverage with true risk |
| Standardize clinic tariffs      | Ensures equity across cities   |
| Introduce basic fraud scoring   | Catches anomalies early        |

* Phase 3 – Strategic Initiatives (2–4 Months)

| Move                                   | Impact                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Predictive pricing by disease and city | Strengthens financial forecasting  |
| AI-based anomaly detection             | Identifies suspicious claims early |

In short: PawSure doesn’t need to deny more claims — we need to pay smarter, guided by real-time intelligence.
